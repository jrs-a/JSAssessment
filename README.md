# Implementing Error and Functions in Solidity

This is a solidity project where I implement `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` functionalities in a smart contract.

For demonstration and learning purposes, this is a project for a coffee maker where it does error handling on user input using the said functionalities so that it doesn't overflow beyond the specified amount!
