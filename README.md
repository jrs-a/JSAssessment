# Metacrafters Projects Repository
This project creates and mints a token with a smart contract written in solidity deployed in [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

## Description
This project demonstrates the creation of minting of a Token that is an ERC20 Token and Ownable. This project's smart contract is written in Solidity and deployed in [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/). In this smart contract, only the owner of the token can mint tokens to a provided address, while any user is able to burn and transfer tokens.

## Getting Started
Start by creating a new workspace in [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and select the ERC20 Template when prompted. Check the 'mintable' option. Copy the MyToken.sol code from this repository and then paste it on the remix IDE's MyToken.sol. Compile and Deploy by using the buttons on the left navigation side of the IDE.
