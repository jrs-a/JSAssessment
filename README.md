# Minting a Token
This solidity project demonstrates the minting of a token where the functions `mint()` and `burn()` are implemented.

## Description
This program is written in solidity for the purpose of minting a token. This program has the `mint()` and `burn()` functions both of which accepts an address and value to mint or burn. The program also has a conditional to make sure that it doesn't burn more than it currently has.

## Getting Started
The [Remix](remix.ethereum.og) IDE was used to run the program. Create a new file under the contracts and paste the contents of MyToken.sol and save it with the similar filename. Do the same as well for the deploy.js under the scripts folder.
Compile the file by going to the file of MyToken.sol and clicking on the 'compile' button. Deploy and test the functions by navigating on the deploy button on the right side and clicking on 'deploy' and the appropriate buttons.
